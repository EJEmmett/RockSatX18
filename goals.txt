Slide 31 - 
Give me a brief overview of your final software design          //
Software flow diagram should be included                        // Flowchart from last slides - cut out calculate
Could include State diagrams                                    // Could change to State diagrams
Could include function overviews (input/output)                 // Have input/output

Slide 32 -
// Flowchart from last time but more complex

Slide 49 -
What discrete blocks of code need to be completed?              // Moving flowchart into block diagram
Which blocks depend on other blocks?                            // All blocks depend on the input of devices
Use your Software Flow Diagram above if you like                // 
Present a plan/schedule that supports your testing/prototyping schedule     // We will work with other teams to test our premade data organizing programs as the CubeSats are being put into place
Include schedule margin                                         // TBD

Slide 52 - 
Consider how software and electrical depend on each other for testing           // We will be able to test our data inputs and outputs independent of the completion of the CubeSats, but when everything is connected, final tests will result in changes based on the programs environments
Present a brief overview of what portions of the code need to be completed to test the electrical system at its various testing points
When will these tests be performed?                                             // All of our program can be finished before the project is tested, given that we use variables that can be easily reassigned
Discuss any software inhibits you may need for Wallops testing                  // We have not foreseen any software inhibitions that may prevent us from operating

//
//Input:
//  Temperature
//  Radiation level
//  
//  (stationary)
//  3 Lazers (0 or 1)
//  
//Output:
//  Speed (off lazer to next on lazer) 
//  Distance ()
//  Size of object (speed * time from {lazer on to lazer off})
//  Direction (which lazer is activated)
//  
//Text file with the results.
//Connection between the two Pi's
